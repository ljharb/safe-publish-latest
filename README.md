Ensure that when you `npm publish`, the "latest" tag is only set for the truly latest version.

## Usage

Add "safe-publish-latest" to your `package.json`'s "prepublish" script, and install `in-publish`.

It will only activate during an actual `npm publish` - it will silently do nothing during installs, and will error when run directly.

Example `package.json` excerpt with no other prepublish commands:
```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"prepublishOnly": "safe-publish-latest",
		"prepublish": "not-in-publish || npm run prepublishOnly"
	}
}
```

Example `package.json` excerpt with another prepublish command:
```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"prepublishOnly": "safe-publish-latest && npm run build",
		"prepublish": "not-in-publish || npm run prepublishOnly"
	}
}
```


## Tests
Simply clone the repo, `npm install`, and run `npm test`
